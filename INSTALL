rtGui is a web based front end for rTorrent - the Linux command line BitTorrent client.  It's written in PHP and uses XML-RPC to communicate with the rTorrent client.

== Requirements ==
  * rTorrent minium 0.8.2 / libtorrent 0.12.2 complied with XML-RPC library support - see http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/ (rTorrent 0.8.4 / libtorrent 0.12.4 also supported)
  * XML-RPC library - see http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/
  * Apache webserver configured with XML-RPC - see http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentXMLRPCGuide
  * PHP 5 with XML-RPC module - see http://www.php.net/
  * A web browser - see http://www.mozilla.com/

== Installation ==
  * Modify your Apache and rTorrent installations to work with XML-RPC 
   - see http://code.google.com/p/rtgui/wiki/ubuntu_rtgui
  * Change to your webserver root directory, eg:
   cd /srv/www/htdocs
  * Extract the files from the archive you downloaded:
   tar xvzf rtgui-x.x.x.tgz
  * If this is a new installation, copy example config file:
   cp config.php.example config.php
  * Check settings:
   gedit config.php
  * Point your web browser to the directory, eg:
   http://localhost/rtgui
  * Enjoy :)

== Known Problems ==
Incorrect file size display on torrents over 4GB - see http://code.google.com/p/rtgui/wiki/CompilingRtorrent and http://code.google.com/p/rtgui/issues/detail?id=1&can=1

== Security considerations ==
Absolutely no thought whatsoever has been given to security in rtGui - do not run this on a publicly available website.  rtGui is intended for 'home' use where users can be considered as trusted.  A basic authentication mechanism is planned for future releases.  At the very least, you should password protect your webserver using .htaccess or similar (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htaccess for more info).

== In Development ==
  * More torrent file management - move directory, delete from disk, etc.

== Wanted! ==
Feedback!

== Other information ==
  * rtGui incorporates the excellent subModal script by Seth Banks for the cool 'Web 2.0' background-dimming/dialog effect - included version 1.5 by permission - see http://www.subimage.com/dhtml/subModal/
  * Also uses some icons from http://www.famfamfam.com/
